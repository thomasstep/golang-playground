# golangplayground

Experimentation with Go

# Package

As I was creating this repo I read up and learned that golang package names can only consist of letters and underscores (`_`). If you look back at the first commit I used a hyphen (`-`) and in the second commit fixed it...whoops.

# File Structure

I tried to follow https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

# Building and running

A script is included to build binaries and place them in the `bin/` folder.
